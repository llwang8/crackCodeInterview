72 Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: fresher, technical
lead (TL),productmanager(PM) Therecanbemultipleemployees,butonlyoneTLorPM
An incoming telephone call must be allocated to a fresher who is free.  If a fresher
can’t handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to technical lead.  If the TL
is
not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to PM.  Design
the
classes and data structures for this problem Implement a method getCallHandler()

7.8 Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on
the other When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides,
or both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is  ipped On your
turn, you must capture at least one of your opponent’s pieces The game ends when either
user has no more valid moves, and the win is assigned to the person with the most pieces Implement the object oriented design for Othello ________________________________________________________________pg 163

ory  le system Illustrate with an example in code where possible
