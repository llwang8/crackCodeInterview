51 You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j
Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e g , M becomes
a substring of N located at i and starting at j)
EXAMPLE:
Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10101, i = 2, j = 6
Output: N = 10001010100

binary rep- resentation If the number can not be represented accurately in binary,
print “ERROR”

as possible (e g , bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, etc)

57 An array A[1 n] contains all the integers from 0 to n except for one number
which is missing In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in A with a
single opera-tion The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation
we can use to access them is “fetch the jth bit of A[i]”, which takes constant time
Write code to  nd the missing integer Can you do it in O(n) time?
