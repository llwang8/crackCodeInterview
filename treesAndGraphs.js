41 Implement a function to check if a tree is balanced For the purposes of this
question, a balanced tree is de ned to be a tree such that no two leaf nodes di er
in distance from the root by more than one

all the nodes at each depth (i e , if you have a tree with depth D, you’ll have D
linked lists)

hun- dreds of nodes Create an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1

48 You are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value Design an algorithm
o print all paths which sum up to that value Note that it can be any path in the
tree - it does not have to start at the root
